This is just a quick reference.  See the installation instructions in the
documentation for a complete reference.

To generate the documentation, run:
    doxygen Doxyfile

To build and use, just run the following:
    aclocal
    automake --add-missing --foreign
    autoconf
    configure
    make

  OR

    export AUTOMAKE='automake --foreign' (if you're using a Bourne shell, 
                                          otherwise do the equivalent step for 
                                          setting an environment variable;
                                          also, putting this in your .*rc file
                                          is probably a good idea)
    autoreconf --force --install --symlink --verbose
    configure
    make

To execute the tests, run:
    make check
