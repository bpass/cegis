  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Albers projection is 
  exclusively used by the USGS for sectional maps of all 50 U.S. states in the 
  National Atlas of 1970, and for other U.S. Maps at scales of 1:2,500,000 or 
  smaller. The latter maps include the base maps of the United States issued 
  in 1961,1967, and 1972, the Tectonic Map of the United States (1962), and 
  the Geological Map of the United States (1974), all at 1:2,500,000.</P>
  <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale factor along the 
  meridians is the reciprocal of the scale factor along the parallels in order 
  to maintain equal area.  An important characteristic of all normal conic 
  projections is that scale is constant along any given parrallel. Like other 
  normal conics, the Albers Equal-Area Conic projections have concentric arcs 
  of circles for parallels and equally spaced radii as meridians.  The 
  parallels are not equally spaced, but they are fathest apart in the 
  latitudes between the standard parallels and closer together to the north 
  and south. The pole is not the center of the circles, but is normally an 
  arc itself. 
  </P>
  <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the pole is taken as one 
  of the two standard parallels, Albers formulas reduce to a limiting form of 
  the projection called  <a href="./LambEqAreaCon.html">Lambert's Equal-Area 
  Conic</a>.  If the pole is the only standard parallel, the Albers formulas 
  simplifies to provide the polar aspect to the <a href="./LambAzEqArea.html">
  Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area</a>. In both of these limiting cases, the pole 
  is the point. If the Equator is the one standard parrallel, the projection 
  becomes <a href="./Lambert0deg.html">Lambert's Cylindrical Equal-Area</a>, 
  but the formulas must be modified. None of these extreme cases applies to 
  the normal use of Albers, with standard parallels in the temperate zones, 
  such as usage for the United States.
  </P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To map a given region, 
  standard parallels should be selected to minimize variations in scale. 
  Standard parallels are correct in scale along the parrallel and they are 
  correct in every direction. Thus, there is no angular distortion, and 
  conformality exists along these standard parallels, even on an equal area 
  projection.
