  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth of seven 
  projections proposed by Johann Hinrich Lambert, and occasionally given 
  his name (<a href="./Lambert0deg.html">Lambert's Cylindrical Equal-Area</a>), 
  is the Cylindrical Equal-Area. Walther Behrman (1910) of Germany developed 
  a variation of the Cylindrical Equal-Area aptly named the Behrman 
  Cylindrical Equal-Area projection.  The Behrman Cylindrical Equal-Area 
  projection is a modified version of the Cylindrical Equal-Area, where the 
  projection is compressed from east to west and expanded by the same ratio 
  from north to south, thereby moving the parrallel of no distortion from 
  the Equator to latitude 30 degrees.</P>
