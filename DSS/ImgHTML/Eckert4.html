  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1906 Max Eckert 
  (1868-1938)of Keil, Germany, presented a set of six new global 
  projections in which all poles are lines half as long as the Equator. 
  Numbers 4 and <a href="./Eckert6.html">6</a> are of the most significant. 
  No's 2,4, and <a href="./Eckert6.html">6</a> are equal-area projections, 
  and no's 1,3, and 5 are not equal-area, but have equally spaced 
  parrallels.  The Eckert 4 or (more commonly reffered with the Roman 
  numeral IV) projection is commonly used in the US. It ranked third as an 
  equal-area world map projection in U.S. textbooks between 1940 and 1960.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meridians on no.'s 3 
  and 4 are elliptical arcs, with the exception of the straight central 
  meriadians,and semicircular outer meridians. Parrallels are unequally 
  spaced straight lines parrallel to each other. Poles are straight lines 
  half the length of the equator.  Additionally, the scale is true along 
  the 30 &deg 40' N and S.
