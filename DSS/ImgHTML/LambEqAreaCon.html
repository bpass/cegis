  </H3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lambert's Equal-Area
  Conic is closely related to the <a href="./Albers.html">Albers</a> projection.The 
  <a href="./Albers.html">Albers</a> is the projection
  exclusively used by the USGS for sectional maps of all 50 U.S. states in the National 
  Atlas of 1970. If the pole is taken as one of the two standard parallels,
  <a href="./Albers.html">Albers</a> formulas reduce to a limiting form of the 
  projection called Lambert's Equal-Area Conic (shown above). The scale factor along 
  the meridians is the reciprocal of the scale factor along the parallels, to 
  maintain equal area. An important characteristic of all normal conic projections 
  is that scale is constant along any given parrallel. Like other normal conics, 
  the Lambert's Equal-Area Conic projections has concentric arcs of circles for 
  parallels and equally spaced radii as meridians. The parallels are not equally 
  spaced, but they are fathest apart int the latitudes between the standard 
  parallels and closer together to the north and south. The pole is not the 
  center of the circles, but is normally an arc itself.
