  Usage:
  *<a name="USAGE"></a>
  </H3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
  <a href="./Albers.html">Albers</a> is the projection
  exclusively used by the USGS for sectional maps of all 50 U.S. states in the National 
  Atlas of 1970. If the Equator is the one standard parrallel, the projection becomes
  Lambert's Cylindrical Equal-Area, but the <a href="./Albers.html">Albers</a> 
  formulas must be modified. The scale factor along the meridians is the reciprocal 
  of the scale factor along the parallels, to maintain equal area. An important 
  characteristic of all normal conic projections is that scale is constant along 
  any given parrallel. Like other normal conics, the Lambert's Equal-Area Conic 
  projections has concentric arcs of circles for parallels and equally spaced 
  radii as meridians. The parallels are not equally spaced, but they are fathest
  apart int the latitudes between the standard parallels and closer together to 
  the north and south. The pole is not the center of the circles, but is normally 
  an arc itself.
