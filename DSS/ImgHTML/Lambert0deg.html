  </H3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Cylindrical 
  Equal-Area Projection was proposed by Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1772. 
  It has seldom been used, except as a textbook example of the most easily 
  constructed equal-area projection, but several modifications have been 
  published.  The modifications consist of compressing the projection from 
  east to west and expanding it in the same ratio from north to south, 
  thereby moving the parallel of no distortion from the Equator to other 
  latitudes.  Cylindrical Equal-Area Projections are not recommended for 
  world maps, because of extreme shape distortion away from the standard 
  parallels. Other equal-area projections have much less shape distortion 
  away from the parallels of true scale.
