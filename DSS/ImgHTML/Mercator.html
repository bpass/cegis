  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meridians of longitude of 
  the Mercator projection are vertical parallel and equally spaced lines, 
  cut at right angles by horizontal straight parallels which are 
  increasingly spaced toward each pole so that conformality exists.  
  The spacing of parallels at a given latitude on the sphere is 
  proportional to the secant of the latitude.</P><P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is used for navigation 
  since it allows a sailing route between two points be represented as a 
  straight line.  The Mercator projection has been standard since 1910 for 
  nautical charts prepared by the former U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. </P><P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though it increasing distorts 
  area as you get near the poles, the Mercator projection 
  is fundamental in the development of map projections, especially those 
  which are conformal.  It remains a standard navigation tool.  It is also 
  especially suitable for conformal maps of equatorial regions.</P><P>
