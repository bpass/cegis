  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mollweide projection is an 
  equal-area projection of the Earth within an ellipse.  It was presented by 
  Carl B. Mollweide in 1857 and has been called Babinet's Equal-Surface or 
  the Elliptical projection, but it is most often called the Mollweide, 
  Homalographic, or Homolographic.</P><P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has inspired the 
  <a href="./GoodeHomolosine.html">Homolosine</a> projection, 
  <a href="VanDerGrinten.html">Van der Grinten</a> projection, and the 
  Boggs Eumporphic projection.  It did have a smaller influence with other 
  projections, especially pseudocylindrical, some of which have lines for 
  poles.</P><P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mollweide projection only 
  has two points on it that are completely distortion free, lattitudes 
  40°44'12" N. and S. on the central meridian, thus, it is usually used as a 
  world map, at a small scale, and occasionally for a very large region 
  such as the Pacific Ocean.</P><P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mollweide projection is 
  shown in an ellipse with the Equator, its major axis, twice as long the 
  central meridian, and its minor axis.  The meridians 90° east and west of 
  the central meridian form a complete circle.  All other meridians are 
  elliptical arcs which, with their opposite numbers on the other side of 
  the central meridian, form complete ellipses which meet at the two poles.  
  The central meridian is the major axis of meridian ellipses less than 90° 
  from it, and a portion of the Equator is the minor axis.  Meridians 
  greater than 90° have the reverse arrangement for their axes.  Meridians 
  are equally spaced along the Equator and along all other parallels.  The 
  90th meridians form a circle.</P><P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parallels of latitude are 
  straight parallel lines, but they are not equally spaced.  Their spacing 
  may be determined from the facts that the projection is equal-area and 
  that the 90th meridians are circular.  As a result, the regions along the 
  Equator are stretched 23 percent in a north-south direction relative to 
  east-west dimensions.  This strectching decreases along the central 
  meridian to zero at the 40°44' latitudes, and becomes compression nearer 
  the poles.  The distortion near the outer meridians is considerable at 
  high latitudes, but less than that of the <a href ="./Sinusoidal.html"> 
  Sinusoidal projection</a>. </P><P>
