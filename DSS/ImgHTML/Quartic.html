  Central Meridian: Straight line 0.45 as long as the Equator.</P><P>
  Other Meridians: Equally spaced quartic (fourth-order equation) curves 
  that are concave toward the central meridian.</P><P>
  Parallels: Unequally spaced straight parallel lines that are 
    perpendicular to the central meridian. Their spacing changes 
    gradually and is greatest near the Equator.</P><P>
  Poles: Points. </P><P>
  Symmetry: About the central meridian or the Equator.</P><P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Quartic Authalic projection 
  is an equal-area projection. Its scale is true along the Equator, constant 
  along any parallel, and between any pair of parallels equidistant from the 
  Equator. Its distortion is severe near the outer meridians at high 
  latitudes, but less so than on the Sinusoidal projection. It is free of 
  distortion along the Equator. This projection is not conformal or 
  equidistant.</P><P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This projection has one 
  standard parallel, which is by definition fixed at 0º.</P><P>
