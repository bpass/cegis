  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Robinson projection is 
  highly unique.  It was created by trial-and-error computer simulations 
  that were used to develop a table that allows a cartographer to look up 
  how far above or below a Robinson map's equator a particular line of 
  latitude will be located, and then to estimate (via a simple interpolation 
  process) where along this line a particular longitude will fall. Due to 
  its unique development method it doesn't fall into any category easily, 
  but it can be best described as pseudocylindrical.</P><P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Robinson projection is 
  basically secant, with lines of tangency running along the 38° 0' 0"N 
  and 38° 0' 0"S lines of latitude.</P><P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Robinson projection in 
  non-conformal.  The distortion is not overly bad between 45° N. and S. 
  of the Equator and 45° E. and W. of the main meridian.  Outside those 
  boundaries the distortion gets pretty bad.</P><P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Robinson projection is not 
  equidistant or azimuthal.  There is no point or points from which all 
  distances are shown accurately and there is no point or points from 
  which all directions are shown accurately.
  </P><P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary purpose of the 
  Robinson projection is to create visually appealing maps of the entire 
  world. It is a compromise projection; it does not eliminate any type of 
  distortion, but it keeps the levels of all types of distortion relatively 
  low over most of the map. </P><P>
