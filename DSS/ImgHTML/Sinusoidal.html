  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sinusodial projection is 
  used for world maps as well as maps of continents and other regions, 
  especially those bordering the Equator.  Among the first to show the 
  Sinusoidal projection was Jean Cossin of Deippe, who used it for a world 
  map of 1570.  In addition, it was used by Jodocus Hondius for maps of 
  South America and Africa in some of his editions of Mercator's atlases of 
  1606-1609.  Nicolas Sanson (1600-67) of France used it in about 1650 for 
  maps of continents, while John Flamsteed (1646-1719) of England later 
  used it for star maps.  While maps of North America are no longer drawn 
  to the Sinusoidal, South America and Africa are still shown on this 
  projection in recent Rand McNally atlases.<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplicity of construction, 
  either graphically or mathematically, combined with the useful features 
  obtained, make the Sinusoidal projection popular.  On the normal 
  Sinusoidal projection, the parallels of latitude are equally spaced 
  straight parallel lines, and the central meridian is a straight line 
  crossing the parallels perpendicularly.  The Equator is marked off from 
  the central meridian equidistantly for meridians at the same scale
  as the latitude markings on the central meridian, so the Equator for a 
  complete world map is twice as long as the central meridian.  The other 
  parallels of latitude are also marked off for meridians in proportion to 
  the true distances from the central meridian.  The meridians connect 
  these markings from pole to pole.  Since the spacings on the parallels are 
  proportional to the cosine of the latitude, and since the parallels are 
  equally spaced, the meridians form curves which may be called cosine, 
  sine, or sinusoidal curves.<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas are shown correctly.  
  There is no distortion along the Equator and central meridian, but 
  distortion becomes pronounced near the outer meridians, especially in the 
  polar regions.  It is adequate for small scale usage.<P>
