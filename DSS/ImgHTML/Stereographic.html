  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 1595 the Stereographic 
  projection was mainly used to map the stars.  Once it was used for the 
  world maps of the atlas of 1595 it became very popular among 
  cartographers.<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oblique aspect of the 
  Stereographic projection has been recently used in the spherical form by 
  the USGS for circular maps of portions of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, 
  generally centered on a basin.  The USGS is curently using the spherical 
  oblique aspect to prepare 1:10,000,000-scale maps of Hydrocarbon Provinces 
  for three continents after a least-squares analysis of over 100 points on 
  each continent to determine optimum parameters for a common conformal 
  projection.<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The USGS has most often used 
  the Stereographic projection in the polar aspect and ellipsoidal form for 
  maps of Antartica.  In 1962, a United Nations conference changed the polar 
  portion of the International Map of the World from a modified Polycondic 
  to the polar Stereographic.  The Astrogeology Center of the Geological 
  Survey at Flagstaff, AZ, has been using the polar Stereographic for the 
  mapping of polar areas of every planet and satellite for which there is 
  sufficient information.  The USGS is preparing a geologic map of the 
  Arctic drawn to the Stereographic projection.<P>
