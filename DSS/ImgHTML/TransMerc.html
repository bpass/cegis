  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the regular 
  <a href="./Mercator.html">Mercator</a> projection has little error close 
  to the Equator, it has been found very useful in the transverse form, 
  with the equator of the projection rotated 90º to coincide with the 
  desired central meridian.  The central meridian can be made true to scale,
  no matter how far north and south the map extends, and regions near it are 
  mapped with low distortion.  The Transverse Mercator projection can be 
  seen as a conformal adaption of the <a href= "./Sinusoidal.html">
  Sinusoidal</a> projection.  Like the regular <a href="./Mercator.html">
  Mercator</a>, the map is conformal.<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been little use of 
  the Transverse Mercator projection for single maps of continental areas.  
  Until recently, the projection was not precisely applied to the ellipsoid 
  for the entire Earth.  Ellipsoidal formulas were limited to series for 
  relatively narrow bands.  In 1945, E.H. Thompson, and in 1962, L.P. Lee, 
  presented exact or closed formulas allowing calculations of coordinates 
  for the full ellipsoid.  <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meridians and parallels of the Transverse Mercator are not straight 
  lines like they were on the regular <a href="./Mercator.html">Mercator</a>,
   except for the Equator, the central meridian, and each meridian 90º 
  away from the central meridian.  The other meridians and parallels are 
  complex curves.<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spherical form in conformal,
  and its scale error is a function of the distance from the central 
  meridian, similar the the <a href="./Mercator.html">Mercator</a> 
  projection whose scale error is a function of the distance from the 
  Equator.  The ellipsoidal form is also conformal, but its scale error 
  is slightly affected by factors other than only distance from the central 
  meridian.  With the scale along the central meridian remaining constant, 
  this type of projection is an good projection for lands extending 
  predominately north and south.<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spherical form of the 
  Transverse Mercator has been used by the USGS only recently.  In 1979, 
  this projection was chosen for a base map of North America to replace the 
  Bipolar Oblique Conic Conformal projection that had been used for tectonic 
  and other geologic maps.<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States the 
  Transverse Mercator projection is used in the State Plane Coordinate 
  System (SPCS) for States that are extended mostly north and south.  
  Excluding narrow states like Delaware, New Hampshire, and New Jersey, the 
  states using the Transverse Mercator projection are divided into two to 
  eight zones, each with its own central meridian, along which the scale is 
  slightly reduced to balance the scale throughout the map.  Each zone is 
  designed to maintain scale distortion.  Since 1935, several states have 
  passed legislation establishing the SPCS as a permissible system for 
  recording boundary descriptions or point locations.
  <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting in the late 1950's, 
  the Transverse Mercator projection has been used by the USGS for nearly 
  all new quadrangles covering the States using the TM Plane Coordinates, 
  but the central meridian and scale factor are those of the SPCS zone.  
  Thus, all quadrangles for a given zone may be mosaicked exactly.  
  The Transverse Mercator projection is used in many other countries for 
  official topographic mapping.  The Ordnance Survey of Great Britain began 
  switching from a Transverse Equdistant Cylindrical to the Transverse 
  Mercator in approximately 1920.
  <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Army Map Service used the 
  Transverse Mercator for two major mapping 
  operations: <P>     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) a series of 
  1:250,000-scale quadrangle maps covering the entire country, and <P>     
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) as the geometric basis for 
  the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid. <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transverse Mercator quadrangle 
  maps fit continuously in a north-south direction, provided they are 
  prepared at the same scale, with the same central meridian, and for the 
  same ellipsoid.  They do not fit exactly from east to west, if they have 
  their own central meridians.  Using the SPCS or UTM projection, 
  quadrangles and other maps that are properly constructed at the same 
  scale, fit in all directions within the same zone.<P>
