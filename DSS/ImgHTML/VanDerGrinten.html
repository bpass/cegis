  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invented in 1898 by a Alphons 
  J. van der Grinten of Chicago, the Van der Grinten projection is designed 
  for use in the spherical form only.  There are no special features to 
  preserve it in an ellipsoidal form.  It was used by the National 
  Geographic Society for their standard world map until 1988.  This map is 
  printed at various scales and with the central meridian either through 
  America or along the Greenwich meridian.  The U.S. Department of 
  Agriculture adopted the projection as the base map for economic data in 
  the 1940's, which led to its use in textbooks.  All the USGS maps have a 
  central meridian of long. 85º W., passing through the United States.<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Van der Grinten projection 
  blends the <a href="./Mercator.html">Mercator</a> appearance with the 
  curves of the <a href="./Mollweide.html">Mollweide</a> an equal-area 
  projection.  it includes a simple graphical construction and limited 
  formulas showing the mathematical coordinates along the central meridian, 
  the Equator, and the outer (180th) meridian.  The meridians are equally 
  spaced along the Equator, but the spacing between parallels increases 
  with latitude, so that the 75th parallels are shown about halfway between 
  the Equator and the respective poles.  Many Van der Grinten maps leave 
  out the polar regions due to polar exaggeration.<P>
