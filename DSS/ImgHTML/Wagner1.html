  Central Meridian: Straight line that is half the length of the Equator.
  <P>
  Meridians: Sine curves (60° segments). <P>
  Parallels: Unequally spaced straight lines. <P>
  Poles: Straight lines that are half the length of the Equator.<P>
  Symmetry: About the Equator and the central meridian. <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wagner I projection is an 
  equal-area projection. Its scale is constant along any parallel or pair 
  of equidistant parallels. This projection is neither conformal nor 
  equidistant. <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This projection was described 
  by Karlheinz Wagner, who described it in 1932.  It was again described by 
  V. V. Kavraisky in 1936 so it is also known as the Kavraisky VI 
  projection.<P>
