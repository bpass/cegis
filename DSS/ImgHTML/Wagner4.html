  Meridians: The central meridian is a straight line that is half as long 
  as the Equator. The other meridians are equally spaced portions of 
  ellipses (less than semiellipses) that would intersect beyond the 
  poles and are concave toward the central meridian. The meridians at 
  103°55’ east and west of the central meridian are circular arcs.<P>
  Parallels: The parallels are unequally spaced straight parallel lines  
  whose widest separation is near the Equator. They are perpendicular to 
  the central meridian. <P>
  Poles: Lines that are half as long as the Equator. <P>
  Symmetry: There is symmetry about the central meridian or the Equator.
  <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distortion is not as extreme 
  near the outer meridians at high latitudes as it is on pointed-polar 
  pseudocylindrical projections, but there is considerable distortion 
  throughout polar regions. It is free of distortion only at latitudes 
  42°59’ N. and S. on the central meridian.
  <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale is true along 
  latitudes 42°59’ N. and S., and constant along any given latitude.<P>
