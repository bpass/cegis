  <H3>Usage: * </H3>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Albers is the projection exclusively used
  by the USGS for sectional maps of all 50 States of the United States in the 
  <EM>National</EM> <EM>Atlas</EM> of 1970, and for other US Maps at scales 
  1:2,500,000 and smaller. Like other normal conics, Albers Equal-Area Conic 
  projection (shown above) has concentric arcs of circles for parallels and 
  equally spaced radii as meridians. The parallels are not equally spaced, but 
  they are farthest appart in the latitudes between the standard parallels and 
  closer together to the North and South. The Scale factor along the parallels 
  is too small between the standard parallels and too large beyond them, and in 
  fact the scale factor along the meridians is the reciprocal of the scale factor 
  along parallels, to maintain equal area.</P>
