Note about documentation.  If you run a program called Doxygen in this 
directory it will read the project description from the doxyfile that 
is here and will generate a whole documentation suite for the program.

If you don't have doxygen you can get it at:

www.doxygen.org

I highly recommend doing so, the documentation is pretty big and 
hopefully useful.
