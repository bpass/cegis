 * \section getGDALLibrary Building the GDAL Library
 * <P>
 * Get the GDAL library from the link on the main page.  You'll want to
 * download the source code version.  After downloading, extract the archive
 * and run 
 * <i>configure --prefix=/where/you/want/to/install; make; make install</i>.
 * Add the /bin subdirectory of the directory to which you installed to your
 * path if it is not already there.
 * </P>
 * \section buildingLinuxLibrary Building the Intersection Locator under Linux
 * <P>
 * After building GDAL, you only have to add the line
 * <i>`gdal-config --libs`</i> to gcc's commandline or your makefile to make
 * the intersection locator build properly.
 * </P>
