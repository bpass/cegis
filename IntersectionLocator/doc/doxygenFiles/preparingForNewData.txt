 * \section newDataInstructions Instructions to Prepare to Process New Data
 * <P>
 * When you get a new set of data to work with you will need to do some
 * work to prepare to process it.  The most difficult part is training
 * the classifier, but there are some other steps that can be a pain.
 * </P>
 * \section clippingVectorData Clipping Vector Data
 * <P> One thing that will need to get done is clipping the vector data
 * so that it covers the same region as the orthoimage you want to
 * process.  The first step in doing this is to open the ortho in a
 * viewer in Imagine and create an area of interest (aoi) outline of
 * it.  This can be rough, it doesn't need to be perfect.  At this point
 * I usually save the aoi layer in case I need it again later. Next go to
 * file->new->Vector Layer ... in the veiwer's menu.  You will then 
 * want to select Arc Coverage as the file type and give it a name.
 * When the program prompts for a precision I usually select single.
 * Next select the aoi and go to vector->Copy Selection To Vector ...
 * After that is done go to file->save->Top Layer As to save the
 * new vector file.
 * </P><P>
 * Ok, almost there.  Before continuing you have to close the vector
 * coverage file in the viewer, or Imagine will corrupt your data.
 * Next go to the main Imagine toolbar and select
 * Vector.  In the dialog menu thingy that pops up select Build Vector
 * Layer Topology.  That will pop up another dialog where you will 
 * select your coverage file you created.  Then change the dropdown
 * at the bottom of the screen from "Polygon" to "Line" and click ok.
 * After that completes go back to the Vector dialog-menu and select
 * Subset Vector Layer.  In this poorly designed dialog you will first
 * select the vector coverage for the original road map file (the big
 * map that we are subsetting).  In the second box select the name of
 * the new coverage that you just created.  Then in the third box
 * put the name of the output coverage that you want to create.  Lastly
 * change the Subsetting Features drop-down box to say Lines instead of
 * Polygons.  
 * </P>
 *
 * When this finishes open up your new coverage in a viewer
 * and make sure that it overlaps the raster, if it does then it worked.
