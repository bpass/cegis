 * \section printingMaps Printing Maps
 * Printing maps out successfully is a pain, but if you work with this
 * code much you will probably need to do it fairly often, so hopefully
 * this document helps to ease your suffering.  I always print to the
 * HP5000_ps in the imaging room because it is the only big plotter with
 * post script support for Arc print jobs.  Also, I print from ArcView
 * because I find its interface to be easier to work with than Imagine.
 * It can't do as much, but what it can do it makes easier.
 *
 * Ok, so the first step is to create your project in ArcView, if you
 * don't have one already.  When you first open ArcView it will ask you
 * if you want to create a new project with a new view, select ok in 
 * this box.  It will then present you with a choice to add data to the
 * view, again, select yes.  This will bring up a proprietary and poorly
 * designed select file box.  Pick out the data you want to add.  
 * Remember that Feature Data Source is a vector format file and Image
 * Data Source is a raster image.  Multiple files can be selected by
 * holding down shift and selecting.  To add another file after the first
 * time you click ok, click on the "Add Theme" button, it kind of looks
 * like a thick plus sign.
 * 
 * Next thing to do is set up the view.  There should be a window open
 * called View1 or something similar.  On the left of this window, check
 * the layers that you want visible, and drag and drop them into the z
 * order you want.  Also, it is a good idea to zoom to where you can see
 * whatever it is that you are planning to print.  One other step is
 * important here.  Select View->Properties from the main menu.  In
 * the dialog for this set the map units to meters, or whatever is
 * appropriate for your data.
 *
 * Now go to the other open window that has the name of your project,
 * probably "Untitled".  Here you will select Layouts on the left, and
 * then click New at the top.  You will be presented with a new window.
 * You'll want to go to Layout->Page Setup and set the paper size to
 * whatever seems appropriate for your project.  I usually use "Custom"
 * and 30" by 40", but you can go bigger.
 *
 * On the newly available tool bar there is an icon called "View Frame"
 * that has a kind of planetish icon on it.  It should be on the far
 * right of that toolbar.  If it isn't than click and hold down the 
 * button on whatever icon is there, this will create a drop-down button
 * selection where you can pick out the planet.
 *
 * With this tool you draw a rectangular area to be the plot area.  Once 
 * you draw the area there is a dialog box that asks what you want to
 * view in the view frame.  Select View1 at the top of the dialog.  The
 * "Live Link" check box will make the view frame change when you change 
 * the view that it is linked to, if you uncheck it the view frame won't
 * change.  I usually leave this checked until I'm happy with the image,
 * and then uncheck it to lock the view I have in place.  Under scale 
 * select "User Specified Scale" and then enter a scale below it.  For
 * roads I always use 1:3000, 1:6000 or 1:12000, usually 1:3000, it gives
 * the most detailed view.  The rest of this dialog is ok, just click OK.
 *
 * Now you should see the image in your Layout.  You can zoom and pan 
 * around in the main View (View1) to change what is shown in the Layout,
 * when you are happy with it, I would go to Graphics->Properties and 
 * turn off Live Link.  There are also some pretty self explanatory tools 
 * for adding text and
 * drawing shapes and such.  Play with these until the image is ready to
 * go.  If you need to plot an image where the points that were filtered
 * out are in red, what I usually do is open the shapefile for all of the
 * unfiltered points and make it red.  Then I open the shapefile for the
 * filtered points at whatever filter level I need and make it some other
 * color.  If the filtered points are over the unfiltered then only the
 * points that were filtered out will be visible, and red.
 *
 * Ok, now to actually print something.  Go to File->Print Setup and
 * select the \\\\mcprint\\hp5000_ps as the printer.  On paper size scroll
 * up and select the smallest one that will contain your paper size
 * that you selected above, and click OK.  Now go to File->Print and
 * hit ok.
 *
 * If all goes according to plan you will have your project printed in
 * about 30 minutes.  If it doesn't you might not.  
 * 
 * The printer has
 * failed for me in about every way possible, but they got it fixed and
 * since then I haven't seen too many problems.  Sometimes it is touchy
 * about file size though.  If you are having problems where the print 
 * job just dissappears, or where you get a tiny strip of paper instead
 * of a 30x40 plot, try decreasing the dpi of the output file.  This
 * can be done under File->Print, just type in the drop down box, you
 * don't have to use the crappy provided values.  I'm pretty sure
 * that around 150 dpi is still better than the printer can handle.
 *
 * If that doesn't help and you still can't print, the man to see is
 * Dave Perdue.  He should be able to help.
