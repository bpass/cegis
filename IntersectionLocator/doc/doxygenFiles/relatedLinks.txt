 * <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~knoblock/index.html">Dr. Knoblock's 
 * Homepage</a> <BR>
 * The paper that this code is based on is on Dr. Knoblock's webpage.
 * The better paper on the process is not there, Mike Finn or Dr. Usery
 * should have that somewhere.  This website contains lots of papers on
 * all kinds of stuff, look for Geospatial Data Integration, or 
 * conflation and you should find some information related to this algorithm.
 *
 * In case you need it, Dr. Knoblock's shipping address is:

 * This is the contact information for the original author of this software

 * \subsection technicalInformation Technical Information
 * <a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/">GDAL/OGR Website</a><BR>
 * This is where you can get the GDAL/OGR binaries, source, and general
 * information on the library.  The IntersectionLocator uses this
 * library to perform file io on geospatial data file types, like 
 * shapefiles, Arc coverages, and tiffs.
 *
 * <a href="http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrcd108/tgr108cd.html">
 * TIGER Vector Data</a><BR>
 * The US Census' site for the TIGER line files that they maintain.  On this
 * page you can download TIGER format files for any area in the United 
 * States.  They also have some information about the attribution of the 
 * files, like what a Cfcc code means, how the TIGER files are structured,
 * etc.

 * \subsection triangulationLinks Triangulation Links
 * <a href="http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~gl/research/comp_geom/delaunay/delaunay.html">
 * A Website on Delauney Triangulation</a><BR>
 * This site describes delauney triangulation briefly, offers some broken C
 * code for performing delauney triangulations, and has a Java applet that
 * does delauney triangulation on the website.  This page is mostly useful
 * for getting a graphical example of how the triangulation works.
 *
 * <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/terrain/triangulate/">
 * A Link to Some Triangulation Code</a><BR>
 * This site has a program ported to several languages for performing
 * the delauney triangulation.  It seems a little complicated and I'm not
 * sure if it would really be an improvement over the current method, but
 * it might be useful for a reference implementation.
 *
 * <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~pless/506/l18.html">
 * Good Code Based Description of Delauney Triangulation</a><BR>
 * This site is mostly description of the process and pseudocode, but it is
 * a pretty good reference.
 *
 * <a href="http://www.csit.fsu.edu/~burkardt/papers/delaunay.html">
 * A List of Delauney Triangulation Implementations</a><BR>
 * Can you tell I had a lot of trouble with this part of the code?  This
 * page has a good list of implementations and comparison of their output.
 *
 * <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circumcircle.html">Circumcircle 
 * Information</a><BR>
 * The method I used for calculating the center of a circumcircle about
 * a triangle was derived from this page.  Working out the determinants
 * on that page for a, bx and by yielded the equations in the Circle
 * constructor that takes a triangle.  See that documentation for the 
 * resulting math.
 *
 * \subsection colorSpaceLinks Color Space Links
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSV_color_space">
 * A Good Description of RGB and HSV Colors</a><BR>
 * This page has a good description of the color spaces and how to 
 * transform between them.
 *
 * <a href="http://www.easyrgb.com/math.php?MATH=M20#text20">
 * Pseudocode for the Color Transformation</a><BR>
 * This page has the pseudocode that I used for the color
 * transformation.
 *
 * <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mer/colour/hsv.html">
 * A Very Nice Description of HSV Color Space</a><BR>
 * With cool pictures!!
 *
 * \subsection classifierLinks Classifier Links
 * <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Forum/1203/NaiveBayes.html">
 * Naive Bayesian Classification</a><BR>
 * This page contains a nice description of naive bayesian classifiers.
 * Also ahs a pretty good description of the statistics involved.
 *
 * <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/tutorials/">
 * Overall Classification Reference</a><BR>
 * This site has a pretty good overview of lots of different methods of
 * classifying things, and has links to more in depth discussions of these
 * methods.  Probably a good source if you are trying to improve the 
 * classification.
