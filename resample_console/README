Resample
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Does statistical analysis on the area in the input image that 
goes into making each pixel in the output image. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:	resample inimg outimg histogram fillval options {Pcl#} {pcl#}

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters:

inputimg	input image with .geoinfo and .proj files

outputimg	name of output image, must have .geoinfo
		and .proj files already created.
		Statistical images will have filenames like
		outputimg.max.img and outputimg.016.img

histogram	The name of a histogram file in the format 
		written by the histo program.  If a pixel value
		has zero "hits" associated with it, the b option
		will not create a band for that class.

fillval		The value associated with breaks in the map, or
		unneded data.

Pcl#		Most preferred class number.

pcl#		Least preferred class number.


Filenames should not have their extensions specified.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Options:
	M	find the most used class value in the input pixel
	m	find the least used value in input pixel (minimum)
	N	write the nearest neighbor resampled image
	C	find how many choices were available per pixel
	b	Create an image for each band showing how many hits
		of that band were in the input pixel
	o	Create the output image.
	P	there is a most preferred class
	p	there is a least preferred class

The options can be listed in any order and in any combination.

If both P and p are used, the most preferred value must be given
first, then the least preferred value.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Naming Conventions:

	If outputimg is named earth, the images created will be:

	             "the" output:	earth.img
	nearest neighbor resample:	earth.nn.img
	             the minimums:	earth.min.img
	             the maximums:	earth.max.img
	              the choices:	earth.choice.img
	          the band images:	earth.XXX.img
	                                   where XXX is 000 - 255 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Examples:

	To do just a nearest neighbor resample:
	resample ex1in ex1out exhisto fill N

	To find the min and max images:
	resample ex2in ex2out exhisto fill Mm

	To create the output image, preferring class 2 most:
	resample ex3in ex3out exhisto fill Po 2 

	To create the output image preferring class 5 least:
	resample ex4in ex4out exhisto fill po 5

	To create the output image preferring class 2 most and class 5 least:
	resample ex5in ex5out exhisto fill Ppo 2 5

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Hints:

  .	The output image must have .proj and .geoinfo files before execution.
	This is how gctp calculates the input coordinates.

  .	Options cannot be separated by spaces or commas, but they may
	be listed in any order.

  .	The Min & Max routines are very simple.  If the input area for a
	pixel has several classes with only one appearance, min will choose
	the one with the lowest class number; the same is true for max.

  .	If a pixel in a band image has value 255, it may have had more hits than that.

  .	When the program is forced to use the nearest neighbor for an output pixel,
	a 255 is placed in that pixel in the choices image, if the C option was listed.

  .	To make a band image for a class that doesn't have "hits"
	in the histogram file, open the file and change the number of
	hits to a positive integer.  Resample ignores the percentages.
	Conversely, to avoid creating unneeded band images, change the hits
	for that class to zero.  If Resample encounters a pixel from a class
	with a zero in the histo file, it is mapped to the fill band.

Notes on .geoinfo files and GCTP

GCTP is very particular about the parameters in .geoinfo files.  The more the
values have been rounded, the more likely GCTP is to spout errors.

If GCTP prints screens full of errors at the beginning of the run, adjust the
upper left Y coordinate so it is at least half a pixel lower.  It may still be
too high; keep adjusting until the errors are gone.

If GCTP prints screens full of errors at the end of the run, it is trying to
output too many lines.  Reduce the number of lines until Resample runs all the
way through.  Divide the output file's size (in bytes) by the number of
samples in the image.  The answer is what the number of lines should be.

If GCTP prints errors at the beginning of each line, adjust the upper left X
coordinate until the errors are gone.  Generally, the number of errors it prints
at a time is the number of samples UL-X is off.

If GCTP prints errors at the end of each line, reduce the number of samples.
Generally the number of errors printed at the end of each line is the number
of samples to reduce by.

Some projections are more particular than others, and a few (Robinson, for one)
may terminate with a segmentations fault if a coordinate is out of bounds.  As
before, if the segmentation fault is at the beginning of the run, adjust ul-y
as necessary.  If the segmentation fault is at the end of the run, reduce the
number of lines.  Segmentation faults due to a too-low UL-X coordinate or too
many samples could occurr at any time during processing.
