Auto-login instructions. After following these instructions you should no longer
be asked for your password with every CVS operation. Talk to Jason or Austin if
you have any problems.

Linux Users:
  Generating public/private keys:
    1) Run "ssh-keygen -t dsa" in a terminal window.

    2) This will ask you where you would like to save the key, with a default
       of "/home/username/.ssh/id_dsa", where "username" is your username.  
       Hit enter to accept this default.

    3) Enter a Key Passphrase (follow similar guidelines to complexity for 
       Windows password)

    4) You will now be told some information about the keys that were saved

    5) Run "cd ~/.ssh" to switch to your ssh directory

    6) Run "cat id_dsa.pub >> authorized_keys2" to append your public key to
       the list of authorized keys

    7) Run "chmod 600 authorized_keys2" to set the permissions for that file

    8) Your keys have now been generated and placed in the proper location

  Setting up linux/KDE to automatically use your key
    1) Download x11-ssh-askpass from this address:
       http://www.jmknoble.net/software/x11-ssh-askpass/x11-ssh-askpass-1.2.4.1.tar.gz
       or if you have labrat mounted, $LABRAT_FOLDER/cartoresearch/CVS_Tools/Linux/
       If it is not there, use google and search for "x11-ssh-askpass"

    2) Use "cd" to change to the directory where you downloaded the file

    3) Run "gunzip < x11-ssh-askpass-1.2.4.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -", substituting
       the name of the file if it is different than the one you downloaded

    4) Run "cd x11-ssh-askpass-1.2.4.1", again changing the name of the
       directory corresponding to the file you downloaded, to switch to
       this directory

    5) Run "./configure"
       (Note: you will not need to change the install option for configure,
       since you will not be installing this program)

    6) Run "xmkmf" when configure completes

    7) Run "make includes" when xmkfm completes

    8) Run "make" when that finishes

    9) You should now have an executable named "x11-ssh-askpass" inside that
       directory

   10) Run "mkdir ~/bin".  You may ignore the error about the file already
       existing if you receive it

   11) Run "cp x11-ssh-askpass ~/bin" to move the program to your home 
       directory's bin folder

   12) Run "cd ~" to change to your home directory

   13) Run "kwrite .bash_profile" to open your bash profile, which may be empty.
       Substitute your preferred editor for kwrite if you so desire

   14) Paste in the following line to that file:
         export SSH_ASKPASS="/home/username/bin/x11-ssh-askpass"
       Change "username" to your username

   15) Run "kwrite .Xsession" and paste in the following line:
         usessh="yes"
       Again, you may use your preferred editor

   16) Run "cd ~/.kde/Autostart" to switch to your kde startup folder

   17) Run the following command:
         "ln -s `which ssh-add` ."

   18) You're all done.  Whenever you login, you will now be prompted to
       enter the passphrase for your ssh keys, and you will not have to enter
       that passphrase again until you start a new session
