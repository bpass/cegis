Auto-login instructions. After following these instructions you should no longer
be asked for your password with every CVS operation. Talk to Jason or Austin if
you have any problems.

Windows Users:
  Generating public/private keys:
    1) Goto Labrat folder /cartoresearch/CVS_Tools/Windows/Key_Management

    2) Copy the following files to a folder on your D: drive
       a. pageant.exe
       b. puttygen.exe

    3) Run puttygen.exe

    4) Select SSH2 DSA as the type of key to generate, then click Generate
       You will need to move your mouse in teh blank area to generate "random"
       data.

    5) Change the key comment to username@centaur.er.usgs.gov
    
    6) Enter a Key Passphrase (follow similar guidelines to complexity for Windows password)

    7) Click save private key, and save it to teh folder you put puttygen and pageant

    8) Leave puttygen open for the following instructions.

  Adding to authorized_keys:
    1) Open putty and ssh to centaur and login as usual

    2) Change directories to ~/.ssh using "cd ~/.ssh". If you get a message that
       .ssh does not exist created it. This is done using "cd ~" then "mkdir .ssh".
       Next, change to that directory with "cd ~/.ssh".

    3) Use "ls" to list files and see if a file called "authorized_keys" exists
       If not we will create it

    4) You will need to append your PUBLIC key to this file. Whether the file
       exists or not I find the easiest way to due this is as follows:
       a. in the terminal type "echo ", but do NOT hit enter (and note the space)
       b. from puttygen copy the contents of the "Public key for pasting..." box
       c. go back to the terminal and right-click to paste the public key do NOT hit enter
       d. in the terminal type " >> authorized_keys" and NOW hit enter

       Note: you should now have a file called authorized_keys with your key in it
       if you type "more authorized_key" and hit enter you should see something like:

[jtrent@centaur ~/.ssh]$ more authorized_keys
ssh-dss AAAAB3NzaC1kc3MAAACBAKd/l6E1/NKbZ6GG5qVdDxkMvQ5AwkWe0N3WXtp8XqS+hxLfeUFY

    5) now run the following command "chmod 600 authorized_keys"

    6) You can now log out of centaur

  Seeting up Pageant to ligin using private key:
    1) Goto the folder you put pageant.exe; right-click and choose "Copy"

    2) Goto c:\Documents and Settings\username\Start Menu\Programs\

    3) If you have a folder called "Startup" go there and skip to step 5

    4) Right-click and choose New -> Folder; name it "Startup"

    5) If your "Startup" folder right-click and choose "Paste Shortcut"
       This will now cause Pageant to start every time you start Windows

    6) From your start menu run Pageant ( Start -> Programs -> Startup -> Pageant )
    
    7) Pageant will now be in your tray (Computer with a hat on)
    
    8) Right-click on the pagent icon and choose "Add Key"
    
    9) In the open dialog choose the ppk file you created in Part I.
       If you followed directions this will be the same folder where the pageant 
       executable is stored.
 
   10) Enter the passphrase you set when you created the key
   
   Note: Your key will now be loaded and you will not be asked for a password on 
   centaur. You will have to complete steps 7 through 10 EVERY time you login to 
   your Windows machine. Pageant does not cache private keys because it would be 
   a security issue.
