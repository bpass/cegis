/*	This program is very simple. Now that you (should) have compiled and run it
	please do the following (see me (Jason) if you have any troubles):


	1) Add your name to the list in the cout statement below

	2) Compile and run the program to make sure that it works as expected

	Windows Users:
		3) Go to where you have main.cpp stored, right-click on it and 
			choose "CVS Diff..." 

		4) When prompted for an external diff program, you can select WinDiff.
			This is usually found in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\Tools\

		5) Review the diff and make sure that what it displays makes "sense"

		6) Right-click on the FOLDER containing main.cpp and choose "CVS Update"
		   This will get the newest version of all files in the project and merge them
		   with yours

		7) Right-click on the FOLDER containing main.cpp and choose "CVS Commit..."
		   This will commit your file changes to the repository

		8) When the checkin dialog appears enter a comment and click ok

	Linux Users:
